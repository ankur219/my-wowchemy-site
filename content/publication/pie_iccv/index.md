abstract: "Pedestrians are the most vulnerable road users and are
at a high risk of fatal accidents. Accurate pedestrian detection and effectively analyzing their intentions to cross the
road are critical for autonomous vehicles and ADAS solutions to safely navigate public roads. Faster and precise
estimation of pedestrian intention helps in adopting safe
driving behavior. Visual pose and motion are two important cues that have been previously employed to determine
pedestrian intention. However, motion patterns can give
erroneous results for short-term video sequences and are
thus prone to mistakes. In this work, we propose an intention prediction network that utilizes pedestrian bounding boxes, pose, bounding box coordinates, and takes advantage of global context along with the local setting. This
network implicitly learns pedestriansâ€™ motion cues and location information to differentiate between a crossing and a
non-crossing pedestrian. We experiment with different combinations of input features and propose multiple efficient
models in terms of accuracy and inference speeds. Our
best-performing model shows around 85% accuracy on the
JAAD dataset."

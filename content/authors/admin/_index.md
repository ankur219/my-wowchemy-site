I am a final-year dual-degree student in the Electrical Engineering department at IIT Kanpur advised by {{< staticref "https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/piyush/" "newtab" >}}Prof. Piyush Rai{{< /staticref >}} and {{< staticref "https://vipular.github.io/" "newtab" >}}Prof. Vipul Arora{{< /staticref >}}. Along with that I am also a Computer Vision researcher at {{< staticref "http://www.moovita.com/" "newtab" >}}Moovita Pte. Ltd., Singapore{{< /staticref >}}. I am broadly interested in Computer Vision, particularly in representation learning and learning with limited labeled data. In the past, I have had the chance to work under the supervision of {{< staticref "https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~vgandhi/" "newtab" >}}Prof. Vineet Gandhi{{< /staticref >}}, {{< staticref "https://vinaypn.github.io/" "newtab" >}}Prof. Vinay Namboodiri{{< /staticref >}}, and {{< staticref "https://iitk.ac.in/new/dr-harish-karnick" "newtab" >}}Prof. Harish Karnick{{< /staticref >}}. 

You can check out my publications below. If they seem interesting to you and you're interested in a potential research collaboration, feel free to contact me by email or Linkedin.
